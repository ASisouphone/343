### CIS 343 - Structure of Programming Languages

## Course Description

Language definition structure. Data types and structures. Control structures and data flow. Lexical analysis and parsing. Interpretive languages. Run time considerations. Survey of programming languages. (3-0-0) Offered winter semester.

Prerequisites: Admitted to CIS Major
Credits: 3

## Course Objectives

The course focuses on fundamental issues in design and implementation of programming languages – language families, compilation process, syntax, semantics, control flow, data types, and abstractions of control and data. The emphasis of this course is not on teaching a particular language (or set of languages) in great detail, but on the process of learning how to learn new programming languages. By the end of the course the student will be able to:

- Describe the building-blocks of modern programming languages
- Highlight fundamental ideas of programming languages
- Assess the features of a programming language
- Employ tools and heuristics for learning languages
- Design programs using different languages from different language paradigms

## Course Materials

- Concepts of Programming Languages, 11 Edition by Robert Sebesta.  Pearson.  The book is required and used.
- Various online resources.  These will be provided.

## Policies and procedures

# Attendance

Attendance is required.  Should you happen to miss a class, any assignments due on that day must have been submitted before the class.  Exams can not be made up without prior approval of the instructor (i.e. not the day of).
Valid reasons for missing a class are documented emergencies, military commitments, etc.

Note that I do take attendance and use it in calculation of grades.

# Academic Honesty

Assignments are to be completed individually unless otherwise noted by the instructor.  Please note that this means:

- You may talk to others about the assignments (it is encouraged).
- You should talk about the assignments in English (or other natural language), not in code
- If you talk to others about assignments I should see a note in your code regarding that.  This means that if you had a conversation with your neighbor, found an article on Stack Overflow, or read something in a book, etc., that you have an obligation to note that in your code comments.

Copying someone else’s code is plagiarism.  This is considered academic dishonesty.  Academic dishonesty can result in a ‘0’ on assignments and a referral to our Academic Honesty Committee for further review.

# Contacting Me

I am often on campus.  Feel free to come by my office anytime I am there, regardless of whether it is a posted “office hour.”  However, the easiest method of communicating with me is via our class's Slack channel.  Instructions for signing up for this channel are available on Blackboard.  I leave this channel up on my computer constantly, and receive emails when a new message is received.

I prefer Slack to answer questions as any question asked (outside of a private message) can be seen by the entire class.  I encourage you to use this method to communicate with your class peers.  You can share code samples and other resources, and discuss assignments.

# Disability Support resources

Any student who requires accommodation because of a physical or learning disability must contact Disability Support Resources (http://www.gvsu.edu/dss) at 616-331-2490 as soon as possible. After you have documented your disability, please make an appointment or see me to discuss your specific needs.
If you have a disability and think you will need assistance evacuating this classroom and/or building in an emergency situation, please make me aware so we can develop a plan to assist you.

# Projects and Homework

I expect you to follow the departmental style guide for all source code.  It can be found at

http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/java-coding-style-guide/

Note that it is specifically about Java coding but is relatable enough for other languages.

Assignments may be turned in up to two days late, with a 10% penalty per day.  There is no credit granted for programs that do not compile.  If you have “test code” in your source code be sure to comment it out so that your code compiles.  I often automate testing of your code using unit testing frameworks.  If your code does not compile my testing will not work.

# Grading

Your grade consists of the following:

| Category |Percentage of Grade |
|----------|--------------------|
| Homework/Quizzes/Attendance/In-class Assignments | 12% |
| Midterm Exam | 18% |
| Programming Assignments | 40% |
| Term Paper | 10%|
| Final Exam | 20%|
| Total: | 100%|

With a grading scale of:

A	  93 – 100%
A-	90 – 92%
B+	87 - 89%
B	  84 – 86%
B-	80 – 82%
C+	77 - 79%
C	  73 – 76%
C-	70 – 72%
D+	67 – 69%
D	  60 – 66%
F	< 60%
