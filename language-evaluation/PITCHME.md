Language Evaluation Criteria
---
We know now that different languages address different domains.  Sometimes that may be enough for us to make a choice.  For instance, we wouldn't want to use Java or Python to make an operating system, as they require an interpreter.

Sometimes though, languages may be more general purpose.  So then, how can we compare them?
---
There are a lot of different criteria. The main ones we will discuss in this class are

- Readability
- Writability
- Reliability
- Expressivity
- Cost
---
We will mostly focus on the first three in this class

- **Readability**
- **Writability**
- **Reliability**
- Expressivity
- Cost
