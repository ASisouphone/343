**Architecture and History**
---
The history of computing goes back much farther than the actual times during which computers existed.

Mathematicians and others were laying the foundations for programming languages far before we had the hardware.
---
Charles Babbage worked on his difference engine; a mechanical device used to calculate polynomial functions.

Ada Lovelave is widely credited with writing the first computer "program"; an algorithm for Babbage's machine.

**Konrad Zuse's Plankalkül**

Pronounced "Tsoo-zuh".

He was a German scientist working on electromechanical relays.

By 1945 most of his work had been destroyed by Allied bombing.
---
**Konrad Zuse's Plankalkül**

Built a computer called the Z4.  He moved it to a Bavarian village and worked alone.

Plankalkül means "Program Calculus".  He developed it for his Ph.D. dissertation.  It was completed in 1945 but not published until 1972.

**Konrad Zuse's Plankalkül**

Simplest data type was the bit.

Other types, both integer and floating point, were built from bits.

Included arrays and record types, included nested records!

It had an iterative statement much like a ```for```.

**Konrad Zuse's Plankalkül**

He even wrote 49 pages of algorithms to play chess, even though he was not a chess expert!
---
**Konrad Zuse's Plankalkül**

Had (what we would consider) a weird syntax.

```
  | A + 1 => A          // This is an assignment statement.
V | 4        5          // V line is for array subscripts
S | 1.n      1.n        // S line is for the data type,
                        // here an ```int``` of ```n``` bits.
```

This statement group would be written more like

```C
int a[100];
a[5] = a[4] + 1;
```

today.
