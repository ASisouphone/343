Contrary to what we think now, it was not written for portability!

Interest in portability came later.

- Popularized syntax we use still today, such as brackets for array accesses (which was uncommon at the time!)

- Introduced the operators ```++``` and ```--``` (invented by Ken Thompson!)

- It is an imperative procedural language

  - Imperative means it gives commands to change statement

  - Procedural means it provides the ability to structure code and call procedures

**History**
***

- By around 1973 the basics were complete enough to rewrite the Unix kernel in the language.

- Toward the end of the 70's work began on making it portable.

  - This means we can take the same code and compile it on different architectures to the same effect.

- After it became portable the popularity soared.

- During the 80's compilers were written for nearly every architecture and OS.

- In 1983 work began on standardizing the language.
