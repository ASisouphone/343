[Python](https://www.python.org/ "Official Python Website") was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer.  He retains the title "Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL) of the Python language.

Currently Python maintains two versions - a 2.7 standard and a Python 3 version.  Many programmers prefer the 2.7 version, but it is due to be phased out in 2020 (was previously 2015 but extended).

The name gives a glance to *Monty Python's Flying  Circus*.

The language is widely used - usually in the top 10 on the Tiobe index (\#5 as of the time of this writing).  It is used by companies such as

  - Youtube
  - Industrial Light & Magic (Lucasfilm!)
  - Google,
  - Firaxis Games (Civilization Series)
  - MANY others.

Python allows programmers to program in multiple paradigms; imperative, procedural, and object-oriented paradigms are supported.  The language also provides some functional features.

Types in Python are dynamic, meaning variables are not bound before runtime.  This makes writability much easier for programming in Python, but affects readability and reliability (due to a lack of compile time type checking).

van Rossum continues to oversee development of Python due to his status as BDFL, but the language is influenced by these general goals:

  - Beautiful is better than ugly
  - Explicit is better than implicit
  - Simple is better than complex
  - Complex is better than complicated
  - Readability counts

More generally, Guido believes "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it" when it comes to programming.

Many of those design decisions can be seen by the syntax that Python chooses to use.  Whitespace is important; therefore indentation is required.  English words are often used in place of symbols (i.e. ```not``` instead of ```!```).

Additionally, due to these design decisions Python is more orthogonal than many other languages like C.

Python is an interpreted language, meaning programs do not need to be compiled before run.  This provides the added benefit of being able to interactively use Python (demo).
