Abstract Data Types, Encapsulation, and Object Oriented Programming
(Follows the Sebesta Text Chapters 11 and 12)
---
Most all modern programming languages support Object Oriented (OO) programming.

The hallmarks of OO are data abstraction and encapsulation.

**Abstraction** is a way of looking at some entity that only focuses on the most significant parts.
---
We have learned about two types of abstraction in this class,

**Process abstraction** occurs when we give a name to a sequence of statements.  This allows us to call upon a sequence of statements instead of manually executing each statement ourselves.  We see this with subprograms (functions).  This was the first type of abstraction in Computer Science, and even PlankalkuÌˆl supported it in the 1940s.
---
**Data abstraction** is much newer, with the ideas for it beginning in the 1960s and COBOL.  C also provided data abstraction with the concept of structs.  This allows us to create composit types.

**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** are enclosures that define a specific type of data *and* the subprograms that operate on that data type.  For instance, we may define an ADT called Spaceship that includes spaceship information, and also the functions that we would call to operate on the spaceship data.

**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

ADTs are defined in a single syntactic unit.  This *does not* mean they are always defined in a single file though (think C++).

ADTs have access controls that can hide information from outside the ADT instances.

This is very important!  It means that the user doesn't have to know anything about the underlying storage or function of the ADT.  All the users need to know is how to use it.

**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

Through the rest of this semester we will use the term ADT to refer to the construct or definition of an ADT.  We will use the term **object** to refer to a particular instance of an ADT.
---
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

We use ADTs as a means of making programs less complex.  It allows us to separate code into areas of concern.  Instead of concentrating on the big picture of what the program is trying to accomplish, we focus on writing robust definitions of the smaller units of which the program is composed.
---
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

An important note:  **all** data types are ADTs.  We tend to forget this when we think of built-in types, but even built-in types are ADTs.

Consider a floating point number.  We don't have to understand how it is stored; in fact there have been multiple different ways to store a floating point number that systems have used in the past.  All we really care about is how to use one.

Even the concept of the byte is an ADT; in reality it is just the turning on or off of some switch.  We don't care how that happens - just that we can use one.
---
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

This brings up an important point: **information hiding** is the concept that we can use an ADT without knowing how it works internally.

This implies

- that ADTs can be very robust.  By hiding the information of implementation we prohibit users from "damaging" our internal data.

- that our code can still work the same regardless of the system on which we are running.  For instance, if we run on a system that doesn't follow the same standard for the storage of floating point numbers, we can still use floating point numbers.  How they are stored on the systems is not important to us.
---
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

We will use the term **clients** to refer to a program unit that uses a specific ADT.
------
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

Other benefits of information hiding (besides increased integrity of the data) are

- the amount of variables and code the programmer has to be aware of is reduced.
- name conflicts are less likely (scope of the variables are smaller).
- changes in how the ADT was programmed do not cause us to have to rewrite all code that uses the ADT
---
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

We need to be careful about designing our ADTs.  If we aren't careful about adhering to proper practice we run the risk of losing the benefits of information hiding.

Therefore we should (in general) not set access to our data as public.

We should always use accessors.
---
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

The reasons accessors are better are

- we can have read-only data by having a getter but no setter.
- we can include constraints in our setters.  For example we might want to limit possible changes to our state to certain value ranges.
- (as already mentioned) changing the way the ADT is implemented does not affect clients.
---
**Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
***

For a language to be able to provide ADTs it must

- provide a syntactic unit to enclose the declaration of the type and prototypes of the subprograms that implement the operations.
- a means to make subprograms visible to clients so they can ask the ADT to manipulate data on its behalf.
- must provide external visibility for the name, but hide the representation
