# Programming Languages Term Paper
***

We have learned this semester about the processes of creating and evaluating programming languages. As a culminating project in this endeavor, you will write a term paper on a particular language.  This paper will be 5-7 pages long (not including title pages, contents, references, appendices, etc.).  And must have a minimum of 5 sources.

You are not allowed to choose any language we have studied in class or as a part of the Computer Science curriculum at GVSU.  You also may not choose a language you already know; this project is all about cementing the process of learning a new language.  Languages that are off limits are:

  - Java
  - C/C++
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Lisp
  - Markup languages (no HTML, XML, etc.).

The language **must** be approved with your professor prior to writing.

## Required Sections
***

The final paper should include the following topics:

### Introduction

  - Provide the History of the language
  - Note the programming paradigm supported
  - Address the domains in which it is widely used

### Data Abstractions

  - Note the data types the language provides
  - Describe the type checking system used
    - Static or dynamic?
    - Explicit or implicit?
    - Strongly typed?
    - Coercion occurs?

### Control Abstractions

  - Describes language expressions
  - Operators and precedence rules
  - Selection constructs
  - Iteration
  - Functions and parameter passing techniques
  - Scope rules
  - Packages/Modules/Namespace capabilities
  - Exception handling

### Support for Object Oriented Programming (may not apply)
  - What syntactic units used for defining classes?
  - Support for interfaces?
  - Data protection mechanisms

### Sample Program

  - Write a sample calculator program in your language.  It should:
    - Continuously take user input until the user asks to quit.
    - Keeps a running tally of the calculation.
    - Supports +, -, \*, /, and exponentiation of floating point and integer numbers (note, you should catch divide by zero exceptions in some way).

## Hints
***

We have discussed Readability, Writability, and Reliability in this class, as well as Cost.  These ideas should show up in your paper.

Code samples are encouraged to demonstrate language features.  If the code sample is more than 5 lines of code it should go in an appendix and will not be counted toward the overall length.

The Sample Program source code should go in an appendix as well.

## Submission
***

Upload either a .docx or a .pdf to Blackboard.  Due date on calendar.
